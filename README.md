# JS-Adventure

JS Adventure is a short browser-based adventure game written in Javascript that tracks the player's local time and weather and includes them in the story.

**Please Note:** You will need an API key from OpenWeather, https://openweathermap.org/api if you want to use the players' local weather conditions. The API key must be added to the file api.inc.php in the secret folder. The secret folder must also be stored outside your website's public folder, or your API will be visible to the web. To allow JS Adventure to access the API key, set the include in api-include.inc.php to the file path to the secret folder. If you do not want to use an API key, set the variable $OWMAPIkey in api.inc.php to the value NotSet.
